bip 32 39 44
SLIP-0010
Need to be able to use my seed phrase from trust wallet or other multi-wallets, and generate private keys for each blockchain I have funds on. Generate a file with private keys for each.


Blockchain	Coin Type (SLIP-0044)	Curve	Derivation Path	Notes
Bitcoin	0	secp256k1	m/44'/0'/0'/0/0	Standard
Ethereum	60	secp256k1	m/44'/60'/0'/0/0	Standard
Solana	501	ed25519	m/44'/501'/0'/0'	Uses SLIP-0010, NOT BIP-44
XRP (Ripple)	144	secp256k1	m/44'/144'/0'/0/0	BIP-44 compatible
XRP Ledger (incl.‚ÄØXVM) depends on wallet N/A Uses XRPL seed-to-address, not BIP‚Äë44

The XVM coin, also known as Volt, is a cryptocurrency focused on the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA) on the XRP Ledger,


TON	‚ùå Not in SLIP-44	ed25519	Custom	Uses TON-specific derivation
Cardano (ADA)	1815	ed25519	m/1852'/1815'/0'/0/0	Uses CIP-1852, not BIP-44
TRON	195	secp256k1	m/44'/195'/0'/0/0	Same as ETH-style derivation
Cronos (CRO)	394	secp256k1	m/44'/394'/0'/0/0	BIP-44 compatible
Quant (QNT)	1110	secp256k1	m/44'/1110'/0'/0/0	Standard
Hedera (HBAR)	3030	ed25519	m/44'/3030'/0'/0'/0'	Uses ed25519 and SLIP-0010-style


For ed25519 chains (Solana, Cardano, HBAR, TON), you use SLIP‚Äë0010-compatible paths.
XRP Ledger (and by extension the XVM token) do not use derivation paths in the BIP‚Äëstyle‚Äîyou rely on the wallet‚Äôs XRPL-specific seed handling.

What I want is to create a simple command line tool that is self contained and can be used in multiple OS', hopefully all three linux, windows and mac. If can be used in android as well, that would be cool.

I would like simply to be able to enter in a multi wallet  passphrase and generate private and public keys for any given blockchain as well as the wallet address for a specified   blockchain/network/coin/token.

I would like this all to be stored in a sqlite database.

I'm thinking that Rust will be preferable to python for this project as it may be better supported with android  (ndk termux) and smaller size overall.

initial blockchains to tarket bitcoin, ethereum, solana, xrp, xlm, ton, cardano, tron, cronos (evm),  hedera, algorand,  cosmos, binance bnb, litecoin, polygon, polkadot, sui,     optimism, iota, xdc, quant (or as many as possible).

We don't need to worry about RPC. The user can verify balance on their own once they have the address. We can provide a link  ‚îÇ maybe to an explorer based on the wallet address and network. But the primary purpose of this is for individuals to have fine access to, control over and access to their private keys.

We want to have commands with options. They can include mnemonic(seed phrase), private key, public key, wallet address, etc.

With the full wallet(s) information, they now have full control, locally, of their wallets and keys and can use any app they choose to import their keys and manage their wallets

Take in mnemonics, private keys, or public keys
Derive addresses
Organize info in a local SQLite database
Output backup-friendly data
Optionally show explorer links (not balances)

üß± 4. SQLite Schema Suggestion
CREATE TABLE wallets (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    label TEXT,
    blockchain TEXT NOT NULL,
    address TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    public_key TEXT,
    private_key TEXT,
    mnemonic TEXT,
    passphrase TEXT,
    derivation_path TEXT,
    account INTEGER,
    index INTEGER,
    source_type TEXT,
    explorer_url TEXT,
    imported_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

üí° Design Suggestions
Encrypt sensitive fields (private key, mnemonic) if security is a goal
Store the source (mnemonic/private key/public key) for transparency
Consider optional metadata for wallet grouping (cold, hot, hardware)

‚úÖ TL;DR: Essential Commands to Start With
import ‚Äî Import wallets (mnemonic/private key/public key)
derive ‚Äî Generate keys/addresses from mnemonic
list ‚Äî View all stored wallets
show ‚Äî See full info for a wallet
export ‚Äî Backup your data
delete ‚Äî Remove a wallet securely

We don't want to require derivation path. That has to be inferred from the other information. We cannot expect the user to know this.

We should require either the passphrase/mnemonic OR the private key. Since private key can be derived from the passphrase/mnemonic. And passphrase is the same as mnemonic so let's just call it mnemonic. Unless you are suggesting that the passphrase and mnemonic are difference???
ChatGPT said:

Great refinements ‚Äî and you're 100% right to focus on user-friendliness while still keeping control and precision.
Let‚Äôs walk through your two main points:

‚úÖ 1. Derivation Path Should Be Inferred
Absolutely ‚Äî users should not be required to input the derivation path.

üîç Solution:
The software should:
Infer the default derivation path based on the blockchain.
Use a known list of standard paths (from BIP-44, SLIP-0044, etc.)
Possibly try multiple derivation paths in fallback mode (e.g., ETH wallets might use m/44'/60'/0'/0, m/44'/60'/0'/0/0, etc.)
You can provide a flag like --custom-path if they do want to override it.

‚úÖ 2. Mnemonic vs Passphrase ‚Äî Not the Same Thing
This is where it's good to clarify some terminology:

Term	What It Is
Mnemonic	The 12‚Äì24 word seed phrase (from BIP-39)
Passphrase	Optional extra word/phrase added as salt to the mnemonic (a "13th word")
Seed	Derived from (mnemonic + passphrase) ‚Üí used to derive keys

üí° Mnemonic is required. Passphrase is optional.
If no passphrase is provided, use "" (empty string).
But they are not the same.

üîê Example:
Mnemonic:    gravity machine north sort system female filter attitude volume fold club stay
Passphrase:  correcthorsebatterystaple

This combo will derive completely different keys than if you use no passphrase.

üîí What Should Be Required?
‚úÖ Valid User Inputs (one of the following):
‚úÖ --mnemonic (optionally with --passphrase)
‚úÖ --private-key

‚ùå Invalid (and should error out):
Only --public-key
Only --address

üß† CLI Command Examples
From Mnemonic (default path inferred):
wallet-backup import --mnemonic "word1 word2 ..." --blockchain ethereum


With optional passphrase:
wallet-backup import --mnemonic "word1 word2 ..." --passphrase "myExtraSalt" --blockchain bitcoin

From Private Key:
wallet-backup import --private-key 0xabc123... --blockchain solana

The derivation path is irrelevant here; just use it to derive pubkey + address.

üõ† Suggested Internal Flow for import
If mnemonic is present:
Use mnemonic + passphrase to generate seed
Use standard derivation path per blockchain
Derive private key, public key, address
If private key is present:
Derive public key + address
Do not store mnemonic (obviously)
Store all results in SQLite:
Even if derivation path was inferred, log which one was used
Optional: store fingerprint or hash of mnemonic if needed for deduplication

**CHECK**
We do not want/need backwards compatibility or legacy code. DB schema can be overwritten. backup copy is in place Old/database/mod.rs. 

**NOTES FROM LAST SESSION:**
Ok. We have the same issue with defining this address index as we did with the account index. We do not want users jumping around missing the next, overwriting, etc.

account-index (3), address-index (5)

Since the grandchildred are the lowest level (with current tech anyway), we will need a new group for them as well. It will auto increment. Right now we have WalletGroup and WalletAddress. We will need to add AddressGroup as well. WalletAddress will have reference to both WalletGroup and AddressGroup. AddressGroup name will default to "index0". User can create a new address group for a given crytocurrency by --address-name (required).To add an address, --address-name, --blockchain and --wallet-group must be specified. Just as the --wallet-group can be changed, we must allow an option to change --address-name. To change --wallet-group, we should require --account (Master account name). To change --address-name, --new-address-name must be provided along with current --address-name, --wallet-group and --account. A user can get the address-name from the "group" information ( we should be sure to provide that infomation as well. account-index, address-idex 0 and address-index 0 name). For listing all addresses:

Need list commands: list cryptocurrencies, list address-groups (must specify Master account name, Wallet Group name, and blockchain), list wallet-groups (must specify Master account name).

Add-address cannot be used for existing addresses. "index0" address is the default name for all 0 index addresses for any given blockchain. We should actually change this to "btc-0", "eth-0", etc. It's created automatically with the blockchain list from import-multi and/or add-blockchain (currently derive-multi). 

wallet-backup derive-multi --wallet-group "MetaMask_Main" --blockchains "cardano,polkadot" --mnemonic "your original mnemonic phrase"
We will be changing the cli command "derive-multi" simply to add-blockchain. 
We will remove the --mnemonic requirement. We already have it in record and adding a blockchain is no security issue. 
We must include --account.

rename-group --old-name "MetaMask_Main" --new-name "MetaMask_Primary"
must supply --account (Master account name)

Will add remove commands. These will require original mnemonic, then a disclaimer that the information will be completely removed including all sub-data (if account removal, all groups/blockchains/addresses will be removed, if blockchain all addressess will be removed, etc.) and non-recoverable, are you sure? Must type "I'm sure" for approval.

wallet-backup add-blockchain --account "" --wallet-group "" --blockchains ""
wallet-backup add-wallet-group --account "" --name ""
wallet-backup add-address-group --account "" --wallet-group "" --blockchain "" --name ""(required! Unique for account)
wallet-backup add-address --account "" --wallet-group "" --address-group "" --name ""

wallet-backup rename-wallet-group --account "" --old-name "" --new-name ""
wallet-backup rename-address-group --account "" --wallet-group "" --old-name "" --new-name ""
wallet-backup rename-address --account "" --wallet-group "" --address-group "" --old-name|address "" --new-name ""

wallet-backup list-cryptocurrencies
wallet-backup list-wallet-groups --account ""
wallet-backup list-address-groups --account "" --wallet-group "" --blockchain ""(optional if empty, lists all blockchains)
wallet-backup list-addresses --account "" --wallet-group "" --address-group ""

wallet-backup remove-account --account "" --mnemonic ""
wallet-backup remove-wallet-group --account ""  --wallet-group "" --mnemonic
wallet-backup remove-address-group --account "" --wallet-group "" --address-group "" --mnemonic ""
wallet-backup remove-address --account "" --wallet-group "" --address-group "" --address-name|address "" --mnemonic ""
all removals:
NOTICE: "... . Type -I'm sure- to continue." - should this be in single quotes " ... 'I'm sure' to continue."?

remove:
wallet-backup remove-blockchain --account "" --wallet-group "" --address-group "" --mnemonic
We cannot remove a blockchain this way because there could potentially be several of the same blockchain. User must use remove-address-group to specify
